<h1>Graphiti &quot;New and Noteworthy&quot; for Indigo</h1>
<p>Last revised March 14, 2011</p>
<p>This document describes the new development topics that were
adressed during a milestone towards the release 0.8.0 within the Indigo
release train.</p>

		Connections</b></td>
		<td width="70%" valign="top">It is now possible to attach
		connections to other connections. The Graphiti metamodel offered this
		possibility already but the framework support for this was still
		lacking. Now, one can define so-called connection points to actually
		split existing connections. Technically these connection points are
		possibly active shapes that can be selected, moved or deleted as any
		other shape. As a tool builder you need to allow this new behavior
		when the user tries to drop a connection either via a <i>CreateConnectionFeature</i>
		or a <i>ReconnectConnectionFeature</i>. Example implementations are
		available in the Sketch testtool in the examples folder in the
		Graphiti CVS. <img src="images/NaNW-Indigo-M6-Connection.jpg" /></td>

		<td width="30%" valign="top" align="left"><b>Font Management</b></td>
		<td width="70%" valign="top">Graphiti now manages the fonts that
		are used inside a diagram just the way it was already done for colors.
		This feature was introduced in order to improve the graphics handles
		usage and number of classes instantiated; multiple uses of the same
		font will now lead to only one instance of that font existing inside
		the diagram. Just as the colors fonts are now managed at Diagram level
		and no longer on the individual graphical elements. <b>Note: this
		is an minor incompatible change in the Graphiti API you will need to
		adapt to!</b> There are no font creation methods any more, instead you
		will need to call manageFont on the diagram. <b>Besides diagrams
		that were created using Graphiti versions before 0.8.0 M6 will need a
		migration</b> if tool defined fonts are used. The Graphiti framework
		provides a small migration utility that can be triggered at an
		appropriate time by the tool. We decided explictly against triggering
		the migration from the framework, because there will definatly by
		different requirements on the time of triggering in the various tool
		scenarios. Besides there will be tools that will need no migration at
		all and would be only suffer a time penalty from that check and
		migration being done in the framework. More details on the API change
		and the migrator can be found in the Bugzilla <a
			href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=323358">323358</a>.</td>

		<td width="70%" valign="top">Graphiti supports printing and
		saving a diagram to an image. There have always been hooks were the
		user can influence the default behaviors for these operations.
		Nevertheless it was not clear if the way this was enabled was really
		feasible. An investigation of the two features that exist for those
		purposes (<i>DefaultPrintFeature</i> and <i>DefaultSaveImageFeature</i>)
		showed that tool builders can rudimentary implement behavioral changes
		to those features (like changing the selection in the editor), so it
		makes sense to keep the implementations available. The existing state
		was documented in the JavaDoc at the appropriate classes and methods
		and a not used property in the save context was removed. This
		functionality might be subject to further enhancement request as tools
		need more possibilities to influence the behavior.</td>
