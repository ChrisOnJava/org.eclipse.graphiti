	<h1>New Graphiti Plug-in Wizard</h1>
	<p>
		This wizard has been introduced with Graphiti 0.9.0 and allows the
		creation of a new Eclipse plug-in project containing a basic Graphiti
		editor. It is integrated in the <i>New Plug-in Project Wizard</i>
		provided by Eclipse PDE and can be started via <i>File --&gt; New --&gt;
			Project... --&gt; Plug-in Development --&gt; Plug-in Project</i>. The user can
		specify the name along with the other settings for the new plug-in
		project and on the third page of the wizard select the template <i>Plug-in
			with a Graphiti Editor</i>.
	</p>
	<img alt="Template selection for new Plug-in with a Graphiti Editor"

	<p>On the next page, the user can change the pre-filled definitions
		of the Graphiti Diagram Type, Diagram Type Provider and Feature
		Provider to be created. The initial values proposed there are derived
		from the name of the plug-in project.</p>

	<p>After finishing the wizard a new plug-in is created containing
		the definitions and basic implementation classes for a new Graphiti
		diagram editor that allows the creation of new shapes and connections
		between shapes. The shapes and connections are not yet linked to any
		domain objects but offer a good starting point for building a real
		editor. The user may simply start a Eclipse Application as runtime for
		this and simply create a new Graphiti diagram with the new type by
		using the Graphiti New Diagram Wizard that comes as part of the
		examples.</p>
