in the IDE (e.g. for setting up a workspace with the source projects)

Important:
If you want to execute and run the tests during a local build sequence, you have to set "../buckminster.properties"
as the properties file for this cquery! Furthermore you have to uncomment the property "buildSitePath" at the end
of the referenced properties file!</cq:documentation>
